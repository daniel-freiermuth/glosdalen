# Notes to the Agent - Meta Information

## üìã Purpose of This Directory
This `notes-to-the-agent/` directory contains comprehensive documentation designed to enable **complete project continuity** even if conversation history is lost. These notes capture:

- **Project decisions and rationale** - Why specific technologies were chosen
- **Critical build configuration** - Exact settings needed for successful compilation  
- **Architecture overview** - How the code is organized and why
- **Future roadmap** - Planned enhancements and extensions

## üéØ Usage Guidelines for Future Agents

### When Starting Work on This Project
1. **Read `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` first** - Understand the goal and current state
2. **Check `BUILD_CONFIGURATION.md`** - Verify build environment before making changes
3. **Review `TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md`** - Understand architecture and design patterns
4. **Consider `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`** - For planning new features

### Before Making Major Changes
- **Update relevant documentation** - Keep notes current with code changes
- **Test build configuration** - Ensure changes don't break the working setup
- **Document new decisions** - Add rationale for architectural changes
- **Update project status** - Reflect current implementation state

### Key Principles to Maintain
1. **"Strong compile-time correctness guarantees"** - This was the original requirement that shaped all decisions
2. **Modern Android practices** - Continue using latest stable technologies
3. **Clean architecture** - Maintain clear separation between layers
4. **Comprehensive error handling** - Preserve the robust error management approach

## üîÑ Living Documentation Philosophy

These notes are **curated institutional memory** that should evolve and improve over time. The goal is to **compress experience into wisdom** - distilling what future agents actually need to know, not recording every detail.

### Curation Strategy: Add, Update, Remove
**Add new insights:**
- ‚úÖ **Architecture decisions** with clear rationale (e.g., "Why we chose X over Y")
- ‚úÖ **Hard-won lessons** that prevent future problems (e.g., "Version X breaks with config Y")
- ‚úÖ **Successful solutions** to complex problems (e.g., "Fixed build issue Z by doing W")
- ‚úÖ **Implementation milestones** that change project status

**Update existing information:**
- üîÑ **Configurations** when better working combinations are found
- üîÑ **Status tracking** as features move from planned to implemented
- üîÑ **Approaches** when deprecated patterns are replaced with better ones
- üîÑ **Priorities** as project needs evolve

**Remove obsolete information:**
- ‚ùå **Outdated configurations** that no longer work or are superseded
- ‚ùå **Superseded decisions** when architecture patterns change
- ‚ùå **Solved problems** that can't reoccur with current setup
- ‚ùå **Noise and detours** that don't provide lasting value

### Quality Over Quantity
Instead of documenting "we tried versions A, B, C, D" ‚Üí Document "Version E+ required for compatibility"
The essence without the noise. Make the notes **more valuable over time**, not just larger.

## üìä Project Status Tracking

### Current Completion Status (as of last update)
- ‚úÖ **Core Architecture**: Complete and stable
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Modernized and working (Java 17 + AGP 8.2.2)
- ‚úÖ **UI Implementation**: All screens functional with Material Design 3
- ‚úÖ **API Integration**: DeepL translation working with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ **Anki Integration**: Intent-based card creation implemented
- ‚úÖ **Data Persistence**: User preferences stored securely
- ‚úÖ **Testing Setup**: JUnit 5 configured, architecture supports testing
- ‚úÖ **APK Generation**: 11MB debug APK ready for installation

### Next Logical Steps
1. **Device Testing** - Install and test on actual Android device
2. **API Testing** - Verify with real DeepL API key
3. **AnkiDroid Testing** - Test card creation with actual AnkiDroid installation
4. **Enhancement Planning** - Choose first improvements from FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md

## üö® Critical Information

### Fragile Build Configuration
The build configuration required significant troubleshooting to achieve stability. The exact versions in `BUILD_CONFIGURATION.md` are a **working combination** that should not be changed without careful testing.

### Technology Stack Rationale
Every major technology choice was made to support "strong compile-time correctness guarantees":
- **Kotlin + Compose**: Type-safe UI with compile-time validation
- **Sealed Classes**: Exhaustive error handling
- **Hilt + KSP**: Compile-time dependency injection
- **StateFlow**: Type-safe reactive programming

### Architecture Stability
The MVVM + Repository architecture is **complete and stable**. Future enhancements should build on this foundation rather than restructuring it.
